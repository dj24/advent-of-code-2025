# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles, written in Rust. This is mostly to challenge myself to learn new parts of Rust.

## Structure
Each day's solution is defined as a member of the root project's workspace, with the main function outputting the answer to console.

## Running Solutions
To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the root directory of the repository and use the following:
```bash
cargo run -p day-x
```

## Testing
Each day's solution includes unit tests. To run the tests for a specific day, use:
```bash
cargo test -p day-x
```
